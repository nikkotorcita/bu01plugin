# bu01plugin
 Flutter plugin for BU01 Bluetooth UHF Reader

TODO:

- implement bluetooth device search, list and connect. this does not appear to work on flutter side - probably due to manufacturer library limitations in the implementation of the android BT stack
- implement getBatteryLevel
- implement better typechecking and null safety checks
- auto format mac address input argument to platform side
